# Attendance System Usage Guide

## Overview
The DMHCA Work Tracker includes a location-based attendance system that requires employees to clock in and clock out using their GPS location.

## How to Use

### Clock In Process
1. Navigate to the **Attendance** page
2. Click **"Refresh Location"** to allow location access
3. Ensure you are within 100 meters of the office
4. Click the **"Clock In"** button (green button)
5. Wait for confirmation message

### Clock Out Process ⚠️ IMPORTANT
1. When you're ready to leave, return to the **Attendance** page
2. Make sure location access is still enabled
3. Click the **"Clock Out"** button (red button)
4. Wait for confirmation message showing total hours worked

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Not seeing Clock Out button"
- **Cause**: You may not be clocked in, or there's an error in the system
- **Solution**: 
  1. Refresh the page
  2. Check if "Today's Status" shows you're clocked in
  3. If still issues, contact your administrator

### "Clock Out button disabled"
- **Cause**: Location access is not enabled
- **Solution**: Click "Refresh Location" and allow GPS access

### "Getting '--' for clock out times"
- **Cause**: You clocked in but forgot to clock out
- **Solution**: Remember to clock out before leaving each day

### "Location outside office" error
- **Cause**: You're too far from the registered office location
- **Solution**: 
  1. Move closer to the office (within 100m radius)
  2. Try refreshing your location
  3. Contact admin if the office location needs updating

## Best Practices
